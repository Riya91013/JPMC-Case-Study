# JPMC-Case-Study

Analyzed data from 42,000 loan accounts booked between 2007 and 2011, along with demographic and credit bureau attributes, to address three key problem statements:

1. Developing criteria for future approval/decline decisions based on historical account analysis.
2. Providing data-driven rationale for the identified screening logic.
3. Identifying and mitigating potential unintentional bias in the decision-making process, particularly concerning sensitive attributes within the dataset.
